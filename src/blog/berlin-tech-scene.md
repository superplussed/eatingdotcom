## Berlin: the future bootstrapping capital of the world

There are a handful of start-up software hubs in the world that have ownership over some aspect of the technology world.  Silicon Valley owns big, overarching ambition.  New York brings to mind consumer-facing commerce, has the most female entrepreneurs of any startup hub[1], as well as having the privilege of being, well, New York.  

But Berlin is different.  As someone who has recently left New York's tech scene for Berlin, I have to say that there is an appreciable reduction in terms of ambition, money, and support.  Which was to be expected: Berlin's reputation has more to do with potential than current performance.  For many it reminds them of the early days of tech in NY:

"Berlin and NYC are like sister startup cities. They remind me of each other in many ways with Berlin a few years behind NYC in terms of its overall development.‚Äù

-- Brad Feld, Managing Director Foundry Group [2]

But what I didn't expect was to find the endless gnashing of teeth in regards to wanting to be what it wasn't: a VC-driven hub in the mold of NY or SV.  

But I think Berlin should embrace what is unique about the city, namely:

* There is not a single other first class city in the world that can be lived in this cheaply.  
* Because of this, talented individuals can pursue their interests without being forever wrapped up in the
* There is a rich and growing pool of motivated talent
* Because of the low cost of living, startups can be funded more cheaply than elsewhere.

But Berlin stick to its counter-cultural roots and aspire to be something of a completely different mold than NY, and that is embracing and supporting the life of a bootstrapping entrepreneur.
