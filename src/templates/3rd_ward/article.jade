  **3rd Ward** was a maker space and educational facility in Brooklyn, NY.

  I was hired to build a new website and internal tooling system to replace their existing systems which had been cobbled together over the years by non-technical employees.  I inherited 6 years of technical and operational debt and worked hard to bring both into a state of health.

  I led a small team that built various CMS systems for the website and our ongoing email campaigns, software for the scheduling and managing of classes and teachers, basic inventory tracking systems, and sales tracking.  I also designed the customer-facing website which was built with an emphasis around photography and bold typography.

  Sadly, 3rd Ward has recently closed it's doors and is no longer operational.  But access to a demo version of the site is available upon request.
